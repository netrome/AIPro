# Multi agent maze exploration
This is an old repository containing the code for an AI project. The code is not well-documented but it is quite simple and modular so it should be no problem understanding it for anyone interested. The report is also contained as a latex file. The interested reader may either just read the file or clone the repository and compile it locally. This is not optimal, therefore all younger projects hosted here have deviated from this pattern.
